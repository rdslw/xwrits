- add xwrits.desktop file and installation

- add xwrits.service systemctl and installation

- what to do about xwrits.spec file (and download url?)

- add printing options and Header on start (check rest_picture & others)

- new option for dpiscalling (or at least allow 2x window/image size)
  + decide how to do it (runtime X11 or GIF scaling, or gif files  :)

- new option to stay alway on top (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4345224/x11-xlib-window-always-on-top)

- consider random password patch https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=315577
  + with printing on lockbar screen in small fonts

- consider exec before/after lock: https://gist.github.com/dmedvinsky/560491

- fix quota, as 'quota=0' behaves unexpectedly, as it results in check_quota=1
  and quota_time=0 BUT LATER in wait_x_loop quota_allotment is messed up :)

- Xwrits should optionally log to a file the number of keystrokes made each
  time period, and optionally some other statistics. Suggested by Miernik
  <miernik@ctnet.pl>.

- I just started using xwrits at work, and I realized that when
xwrits locks my screen is a good time to go elsewhere and do
something else.

To do that, though, I have to first unlock xwrits, and then lock
my screen.  It would be cool if I could type something into xwrits
that would cause it to run a command I set up in advance (e.g.,
``xscreensaver-command -lock''). [C. M. Connelly]
